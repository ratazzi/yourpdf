## 🌐 About YourPDF

YourPDF is a free, browser-based PDF manipulation tool that processes files entirely within your browser. No data ever leaves your device, ensuring complete privacy and security.

Visit [yourpdf.page](https://yourpdf.page) to try it out!

## 🎯 Project Scope

YourPDF is intentionally designed to focus exclusively on PDF operations that can be performed within the browser. This means:

- We only implement features that can be executed client-side using JavaScript
- We avoid features requiring server-side processing or external APIs
- Complex operations that would require specialized libraries not available for browsers are outside our scope
- We prioritize privacy and performance by keeping all processing local

This browser-centric approach ensures your files never leave your device while still providing powerful PDF functionality.
